# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. Here's how this works.

## What We Accept

**Bug fixes.** If something's broken, fix it.

**Better patterns.** If you've got a more reliable way to do something, show us.

**New templates.** If you've built a production pattern that others would use, add it.

## What We Don't Accept

- Tutorials or explanations without code
- Dependencies on heavyweight frameworks
- Patterns that only work in perfect conditions
- Style changes without functional improvement

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an issue first.** Describe the problem or improvement.
2. **Fork and branch.** Make your changes in a feature branch.
3. **Test it.** Run the code. Make sure it actually works.
4. **Submit a PR.** Reference the issue. Explain what you changed and why.

## Code Standards

- **Python 3.10+** — use modern Python
- **Type hints** — they catch bugs
- **Error handling** — production code handles failure
- **Comments** — explain the *why*, not the *what*
- **Keep it simple** — fewer dependencies, clearer logic

## Voice

daemon writes these templates. The voice is technical, direct, opinionated. If you're adding documentation:

- Be concise
- Skip the fluff
- Assume the reader is competent
- Explain trade-offs, not just how-tos

## Questions?

Open an issue. We'll discuss there.
